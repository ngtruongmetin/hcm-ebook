  "thought": "**Analysis of Address Mapping: \"Xã Pa Tần, Huyện Sìn Hồ, Tỉnh Lai Châu\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with mapping this old address, and it looks pretty straightforward, given my expertise in administrative divisions.  First, I confirm the province is Lai Châu.  Now, the initial check of province resolutions (specifically, 60-NQ/TW) tells me that Lai Châu isn't undergoing province-level mergers, so \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\" will remain the same.  That's a good starting point.\n\nNext, I need to delve into the finer details concerning wards. The name \"Pa Tần\" is key here, obviously, and I need to find the specific resolutions that deal with *Lai Châu*. I scanned the resolutions, quickly dismissing the Điện Biên ones, since this is definitely Lai Châu. Resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15 catches my eye. Looking through it, there are several relevant parts. First, I note that Sìn Hồ (the district) is involved in some reorganization but it is merged with other wards to form a new ward named \"Sìn Hồ\". But what is *crucial* here is point 29: it explicitly states that the old \"Xã Pa Tần\" is *merged* with \"Nậm Ban\" and \"Trung Chải\" *to form a new* \"Xã Pa Tần\". Bingo! That's the key resolution.\n\nNow, my next step is to ensure this new ward is represented in the list of new wards. Sure enough, there's an entry with \"Xã Pa Tần\" and \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\". This confirms a direct one-to-one mapping, as expected based on the resolution's findings. This is a very clean match!\n\nTherefore, with high confidence, I can conclude that the old address \"Xã Pa Tần, Huyện Sìn Hồ, Tỉnh Lai Châu\" maps directly to the new administrative unit \"Xã Pa Tần\" in \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\" (with ward code \"03503\"), given the resolutions. The district/town name Sìn Hồ is no longer the correct denomination for this ward.\n",
