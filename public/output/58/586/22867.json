  "thought": "**My Thought Process: Determining the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so I've got this old address: \"Xã Nhơn Hải, Huyện Ninh Hải, Tỉnh Ninh Thuận.\" My goal is to figure out the new administrative unit, likely a ward, for this address. Here's how I'm approaching it:\n\nFirst, I need to understand that \"Tỉnh Ninh Thuận\" is the old province. I need to check for any province mergers or changes, so I'm consulting province resolutions (like 60-NQ/TW). Bingo! Resolution 13 confirms that \"Tỉnh Ninh Thuận\" was merged with \"Tỉnh Khánh Hoà\" to form \"Tỉnh Khánh Hoà.\" So, my focus shifts to the new province.\n\nNext, I need to pinpoint the specific old ward: \"Xã Nhơn Hải.\"  I'll need to meticulously search through other resolutions, especially those concerning administrative reorganizations within the context of \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa.\" My primary goal is to find information about \"Xã Nhơn Hải\" within that context.\n\nI came across Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, but it was about Gia Lai province, mentioning \"Nhơn Hải,\" but it was clearly not relevant to my search. Then, Resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Khánh Hòa, piqued my interest. Specifically, line 39 of that resolution mentions \"Xã Nhơn Hải\" being merged with two other wards to create a new \"Xã Vĩnh Hải\". This is a strong lead, as it aligns with the province change I identified earlier.\n\nTo confirm, I need to cross-reference this information with a list of \"New Wards\" related to \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa.\" I confirmed \"{\"ward_code\":\"22846\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Vĩnh Hải\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa\"}\" is the newly created unit, matching the resolution.\n\nFinally, I feel confident in my conclusion. The old province was merged, and the resolution explicitly details the creation of \"Xã Vĩnh Hải\" from \"Xã Nhơn Hải.\" The confidence level is high because it's a direct, clear match within the relevant resolutions and confirms the newly formed ward name. Now, it's a simple matter of constructing the correct JSON output based on this information.\n",
