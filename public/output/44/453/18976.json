  "thought": "**Analysis of Address Transformation: \"Xã Đồng Hóa, Huyện Tuyên Hóa, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been presented with the challenge of figuring out the current administrative unit for the old address \"Xã Đồng Hóa, Huyện Tuyên Hóa, Tỉnh Quảng Bình.\" My approach will be methodical, starting with any potential province-level changes, then drilling down to the specific ward level.\n\n**Province Level:** First, I checked for province mergers, knowing this is a common occurrence. I reviewed the lists, and fortunately, Quảng Bình wasn't listed under those that *weren't* merging. However, I found under the *merged* provinces that \"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\" has become \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\". This is key and I need to keep this updated province in mind for future steps.\n\n**Ward Level Search:** Now, I'm focusing on \"Đồng Hóa\". I've systematically scanned through the provided resolution texts, looking for any mention of \"Đồng Hóa.\" It's a precise search; I know exact matching is crucial here, since spelling differences are important.\n\nSo far, the search results within the resolutions provided yielded no exact matches for \"Đồng Hóa.\" The closest were phrases like \"Đông Hòa\" in multiple contexts (in An Giang, Đắk Lắk, Đồng Nai, and Đồng Tháp). I immediately discounted these as they are clearly different names, and also geographically irrelevant to my focus on Quảng Bình. No specific mention of \"Đồng Hóa\" arose.\n\n**Confidence Level and Next Steps:**\n\nSince I couldn't find a direct mapping for \"Đồng Hóa\" within these documents, I have a low confidence level about determining the exact new administrative unit based on these provided resources alone. I need to widen my search to include more comprehensive databases or other authoritative sources. I need to consult with databases which have more comprehensive listings of such changes to confirm the result. Alternatively, I would suggest to ask further questions regarding other information of the same given address which could help identify the ward, as I need more information to definitively pinpoint the new ward for the \"Xã Đồng Hóa\" of Tuyên Hóa District.\n",
