  "thought": "**Analysis of Vietnamese Address Mapping for Expert**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vietnamese address mapping task. I've got \"Thị trấn Kim Long\" in \"Huyện Châu Đức,\" within \"Tỉnh Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu.\"  My first step is to establish the context – those old administrative units.  I've got the old ward, district, and province identified, which is crucial for subsequent lookups.  I'm focusing on the province merger as a key piece of information.\n\nNow, checking the province resolutions.  I see that \"Tỉnh Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu\" merged into \"Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh.\" Bingo! This changes everything. My ward search now focuses on resolutions related to Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nI've examined the other resolutions carefully, looking for any mention of \"Kim Long.\"  Resolution 1 deals with Huế, which is irrelevant given the province merger. Resolution 2 mentions \"thị trấn Kim Long\" but it's for Phú Thọ. No luck there.\n\nThen, Resolution 3 for Ho Chi Minh City! Perfect. It specifies the merging of \"thị trấn Kim Long\" and other communes into a new \"xã Kim Long\". My confidence in this is growing, and this resolution is my strongest candidate for a match.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that Resolution 3 also names a new ward “xã Châu Đức”. This is highly relevant because the old address had “Huyện Châu Đức” as its district. This makes me suspect that this could be a case where the new ward name is drawn from the previous district, despite districts being eliminated, which is something I need to keep in mind for similar cases. Therefore, the name \"xã Châu Đức\" can be considered another possible option given that my old \"Huyện Châu Đức\" district is included in the old address.\n\nUltimately, I'm leaning heavily towards \"xã Kim Long\" for the new ward, but I'll also consider “xã Châu Đức” to take into consideration the old district in the original address.\n",
