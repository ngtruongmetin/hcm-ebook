  "thought": "**Identifying the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \"Xã Bình Trung, Huyện Châu Đức, Tỉnh Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu\" and need to figure out the corresponding new ward. The initial step is recognizing that Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu is now part of Ho Chi Minh City, as per the province merger resolution.\n\nMy immediate instinct is to look for \"Xã Bình Trung\" directly, but I need to consider that the resolution might have changed the administrative structure. I'll need to carefully examine resolutions, focusing on changes within the former Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu (now Ho Chi Minh City) context.\n\nI've reviewed several resolutions, including 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1672/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15, and 1683/NQ-UBTVQH15. These resolutions, however, are for provinces like Lạng Sơn, Quảng Ngãi, and Thái Nguyên, not applicable here. While there's a \"Bình Trung\" in some of these, it's not the one I'm looking for.\n\nThen I get to the resolution related to Ho Chi Minh City, which includes a line that is promising, but still not quite right. Resolution 1685/NQ-UBTVQH15 mentions \"phường Bình Trưng\", which seems promising. The text says that the merger made a new \"phường Bình Trưng\", but I'm looking for the old \"xã Bình Trung\". It also seems that this 'phường Bình Trưng' is a district within Ho Chi Minh City. I'll need to check if there is a way to determine how the \"Huyện Châu Đức\" from the old address fits in here. It does not seem like this is going to be helpful.\n\nIt appears I need to dig deeper. I'll have to investigate further to find the right information for this particular ward. Perhaps there's another resolution that I missed, or the merger process may be more complex than a straightforward one-to-one mapping.\n",
