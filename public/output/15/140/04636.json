  "thought": "**Analysis of Vietnamese Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, here's my understanding of how I'd approach this address mapping, given my expertise in this area. I've been tasked with taking an old Vietnamese address and translating it to the new administrative structure, based on provided resolutions and new ward data.\n\nFirst, I've identified the key components of the address: \"Xã Gia Hội\" (the old ward) and \"Tỉnh Yên Bái\" (the old province). My initial goal is to find the corresponding new province and ward.\n\nI knew that province changes were common, so I immediately checked Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This confirmed that \"Tỉnh Yên Bái\" had been merged, becoming part of \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\" This resolution provided a crucial starting point.\n\nNext, I needed to figure out what happened to \"Xã Gia Hội.\"  I meticulously searched the provided resolutions. I was especially keen on finding any resolutions mentioning \"Gia Hội\" or similar ward/district names. Resolution 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15 stood out. It addressed administrative changes specifically within \"Tỉnh Lào Cai,\" which was already promising given the province merge. The relevant part explicitly stated that \"Xã Gia Hội\" was formed by merging other *existing* wards within \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\"  This was a direct hit – the old ward was used to create a new \"Xã Gia Hội\" *within the new* province!\n\nI made sure to cross-reference with the new ward data. There was a direct match: a new ward entry for \"Xã Gia Hội\" within \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\" This confirmed my initial findings.\n\nConsidering the evidence, the province change was a direct consequence of a known resolution, and the ward mapping came directly from the specific wording of resolution.  The new ward data confirmed the change, which indicates a high degree of confidence.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will confidently construct a JSON output reflecting the new ward details: \"Xã Gia Hội\" within \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\"  The JSON structure will clearly reflect the mapping process and my high degree of confidence in its accuracy.\n",
