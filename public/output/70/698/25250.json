  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so the user has given me an old address: \"Xã Phước Tân, Huyện Phú Riềng, Tỉnh Bình Phước.\" My immediate thought is, let's break this down. First, I need to pinpoint the province, which is \"Tỉnh Bình Phước\". Now, the crucial step is to see if any province-level changes happened, specifically if Bình Phước was merged or renamed, and that's where I'll consult the relevant resolutions (like 60-NQ/TW). Bingo! The resolution indicates that Bình Phước was indeed merged with Đồng Nai to form \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\"\n\nNext, I need to focus on \"Xã Phước Tân, Huyện Phú Riềng\". I know that the search is for the ward and the district. Given that the province changed, I need to look for any information on \"Phước Tân\" and \"Phú Riềng\" specifically *within* the context of either the old province or the new one. So, I need to examine other relevant resolutions.\n\nMy search turned up a resolution about Đắk Lắk, which I immediately dismissed because it wasn't relevant to Bình Phước. Then, I found the resolution about Đồng Nai (1662/NQ-UBTVQH15), and this is where it gets interesting. I carefully reviewed the sections, looking for any mention of \"Phước Tân\" or \"Phú Riềng\" within this context. I found matches and non-matches that were worth noting, for example:\n\n*   It does mention merging a different \"Long Hưng, Phú Riềng\" into another ward. That's not a match.\n*   Similarly, the resolution mentions merging of \"Long Tân, Phú Riềng\" into another ward. Not a match.\n*   The resolution also mentioned merging \"Bù Nho\" and \"Phú Riềng\" (which is a ward, not the district) into another ward. Not a match.\n\nHowever, finally, I found a definitive hit: section 57 explicitly states that \"Xã Phước Tân\" and \"Xã Phú Trung\" are merged to form \"Xã Phú Trung\". And, the best part, this is *within* the context of Đồng Nai.\n\nSo, the old ward of \"Xã Phước Tân\" will be part of the new ward, named \"Xã Phú Trung\". Now, I'll go ahead and check the relevant lists within the resolution for further context.\n",
