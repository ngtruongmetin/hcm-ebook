  "thought": "**Address Mapping Analysis: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this address mapping problem. The goal is to translate an old Vietnamese address (\"Xã Bắc Phong, Huyện Cao Phong, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\") to its new administrative equivalent, given some resolutions and a list of new wards.  My initial assessment is to break this down into components: ward, district, and province.  We've got \"Xã Bắc Phong,\" \"Huyện Cao Phong,\" and \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" as the starting points.  Knowing that districts are being eliminated, that district information is going to get absorbed, either into province or ward, so I need to keep a close eye on that.\n\nFirst, I looked at the province level and, as suspected, found something interesting in the \"60-NQ/TW\" resolutions. \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" isn't on the \"no merger\" list, but it *is* on the \"merger/consolidation\" list! It's merging into a new \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" So, \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" straightforwardly becomes \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  High confidence on that.\n\nNow, the trickier part: the ward and district. I need to sift through the other resolutions for mentions of \"Xã Bắc Phong\" and \"Cao Phong.\"\n\nI scanned the `lines` and quickly hit a snag with the first resolution, **1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Khánh Hòa)**. While it mentioned \"Bắc Phong,\" the new ward \"Thuận Bắc,\" it's completely irrelevant. That \"Bắc Phong\" is in Khánh Hòa, not the Hoa Binh area where I started. The provinces don't match up.\n\nThe next resolution, **1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Phú Thọ)**, seems to be where the juice is. Line 67 is interesting; while it includes \"xã Cao Phong\", it doesn't align well with my old address which is \"Huyen Cao Phong\" - it mentions the district but as a constituent ward of a new ward. Confusion. Line 91 mentions \"thị trấn Cao Phong\", which could be the old district's center. This gets my attention because \"Huyện Cao Phong\" is being eliminated. So, \"thị trấn Cao Phong\" is likely being absorbed. This is starting to make more sense. This is a very likely merger, since the resolution is for Phú Thọ, which is where Hoa Binh went.\n\nLine 93, however, looks like gold: it *directly* mentions \"Xã Bắc Phong\"! It consolidates \"Bắc Phong, Bình Thanh, and Thung Nai\" into \"Thung Nai\". This one is the most on-point to me.\n\nTherefore, with that in mind, my most likely conclusion is that \"Xã Bắc Phong, Huyện Cao Phong, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" will likely become \"Xã Thung Nai, Tỉnh Phú Thọ\". This needs validation.\n",
