  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to map an old administrative unit, specifically `Xã Pải Lủng, Huyện Mèo Vạc, Tỉnh Hà Giang`, to its new designation based on some resolutions. The initial step is, of course, to analyze the provided input.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the new province based on provincial-level resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that `Tỉnh Hà Giang` merged with `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang` to become, well, `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`.  So, that takes care of the province mapping.\n\nNext, I have to scrutinize the resolutions for information on the specific ward and district. Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 seems relevant since it concerns `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`.  I carefully scan this resolution, line by line.\n\nI found line 45: *\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của thị trấn Đồng Văn và các xã Tả Lủng (huyện Đồng Văn), Tả Phìn, Thài Phìn Tủng, **Pải Lủng** thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Đồng Văn**.\"* This line *does* mention `Pải Lủng`. However, it's linked to `huyện Đồng Văn`. The user's input specifies `Huyện Mèo Vạc`. This is a significant discrepancy. Perhaps there are two communes named `Pải Lủng`?  Or, perhaps the data is slightly off?\n\nLine 51 focuses on `huyện Mèo Vạc`. It lists communes merging into a new `xã Mèo Vạc`, but `Xã Pải Lủng` isn't included.\n\nI re-examined line 45, re-reading the context.  It's clear that it refers to `huyện Đồng Văn`. So now I consider: is the input correct? Is there a typo? Does the resolution not fully encompass the changes?\n\nI am now carefully considering all possibilities based on the provided data. Based on the name match of `Pải Lủng`, and the instructions to list *all* possible matches, even with low confidence, I have decided on the following:\n\nThe new province is `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang` and the new ward name is `Xã Đồng Văn`, as per resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 45. The ward code for `Xã Đồng Văn` is `00721`.  However, because of the district mismatch (`Mèo Vạc` vs. `Đồng Văn`), I must assign low confidence to this answer. It is the best match *given* the provided data, but there is a clear ambiguity.\n",

The task is to map an old administrative unit, specifically *Xã Pải Lủng* in *Huyện Mèo Vạc*, *Tỉnh Hà Giang*, to its new equivalent, based on the provided resolutions. My immediate concern is that I need to be precise, as geographical data can be very sensitive to small errors.\\n\\nFirst, I identified the key elements of the old unit: *Xã Pải Lủng* (the ward), *Huyện Mèo Vạc* (the district), and *Tỉnh Hà Giang* (the province). A crucial first step is to check if the province has changed. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that *Tỉnh Hà Giang* merged with *Tuyên Quang*, becoming *Tuyên Quang*. So, my initial hypothesis is that *Xã Pải Lủng* now falls under *Tỉnh Tuyên Quang*.\\n\\nNow, the hard part: applying resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15. I began scanning the resolution, looking specifically for any reference to *Xã Pải Lủng* or *Huyện Mèo Vạc*. Line 45 caught my attention: it mentions a *Pải Lủng* being incorporated into a new *Xã Đồng Văn*. However, there's a problem: the resolution explicitly states this *Pải Lủng* is in *Huyện Đồng Văn*, not *Huyện Mèo Vạc*. This raises a flag.\\n\\nLine 51 of the resolution is relevant because it deals with *Huyện Mèo Vạc*, but it doesn't mention *Xã Pải Lủng* at all, only *Thị trấn Mèo Vạc* and several other communes. This is where I have to be careful. Is this a mapping error, a typo in the resolution, or a discrepancy in the input data?\\n\\nThe input clearly states *Xã Pải Lủng* is in *Huyện Mèo Vạc*. However, the resolution text points to the Pải Lủng within Huyện Đồng Văn. This is a contradiction that needs to be addressed. I have to determine if this requires a follow-up clarification, or if there is further information I need to confirm the match.\\n\\nThe input information needs to be reviewed as the resolution appears to point at two separate wards named Pải Lủng.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tuyên Quang\",\n        \"line\": \"45.

I'm starting by breaking down the old address:  \\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng\\\\\\\" (ward), \\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\" (district), and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\" (province).\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand what happened to those provinces. Looking at the Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW), it's pretty clear that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\" was merged into \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\"  So, that part's straightforward – \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\" becomes \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nNow for the complicated part: the local administrative changes. I've got a second resolution (1684/NQ-UBTVQH15) that outlines these. I'm carefully scanning it for mentions of \\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc.\\\\\\\" I quickly see that Line 45 talks about merging \\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\" (along with some other units) *into* a new \\\\\\\"xã Đồng Văn,\\\\\\\" but that line mentions \\\\\\\"huyện Đồng Văn.\\\\\\\" This looks a bit suspect because my address has \\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc.\\\\\\\"  I also see Line 51 that mentions \\\\\\\"xã Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\". But I noticed that \\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng\\\\\\\" is *not* listed among the merged wards.\\\\n\\\\nThis inconsistency requires careful analysis. I need to know if there's a typo in the old address, if I'm interpreting the resolution incorrectly, or if there were two wards named \\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\". The output list confirms a valid \\\\\\\"Xã Đồng Văn\\\\\\\" (with the code `00721`) in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\" and a valid \\\\\\\"Xã Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\" (with the code `00769`) also in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nBased on my analysis: I can confidently say the old province is now the new province. However, I have a clear conflict in the ward mapping.  The resolution line explicitly merges \\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\" into \\\\\\\"xã Đồng Văn.\\\\\\\" But the district information in the address and the resolution is different. This is potentially a significant issue. I'll need to flag this discrepancy and maybe re-confirm the source data or look for additional resources.  It's likely either a data discrepancy or an ambiguous resolution that demands further investigation before I can produce a confident mapping.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"45.

My goal is to map this old Vietnamese address to the current administrative structure. First, I identify the key components: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (province).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe province situation is straightforward.

I'm focusing on Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15. I see two relevant entries. Line 45 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but specifies \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"(huyện Đồng Văn),\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which is a red flag. The input address is in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Đồng Văn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is a critical mismatch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 51 is also interesting; it lists wards within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (e.g., Tả Lủng, Giàng Chu Phìn, Pả Vi) that are being merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The problem is, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't *among* those wards. There's no clear indication of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being merged into a specific new ward according to this resolution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, while the province is easily mapped, there's no direct mapping for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng, Huyện Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new ward based on the provided resolutions. Line 45 is misleading because it's from a different district and while the line 51 lists wards from the correct district, Pải Lủng isn't in there.

Easy enough. Now comes the meat of it. I'm focusing on the province and ward specifically. I've already processed the province-level resolutions (specifically Resolution 60-NQ/TW), which clearly state that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That's the easy part.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe real challenge is figuring out what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I dove into Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15. I was looking specifically for mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within that document. I found a couple of key lines. Line 45 talks about a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but this is where it got tricky. It says \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is merged with some other wards to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đồng Văn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *but specifies that it is in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Đồng Văn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"*.  That's a mismatch with the user's input, which puts \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI kept digging. Line 51 mentioned  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Mèo Vạc town) and other wards *in Huyện Mèo Vạc*, but *not* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The mentioned wards are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tả Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Giàng Chu Phìn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pả Vi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBased on the information, I checked the new ward data. There are two entries that might be related: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đồng Văn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"* (the updated province).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo here's the bottom line: The province mapping is straightforward. But for the ward-level mapping of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" it's not a direct hit. Resolution 1684 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Đồng Văn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mèo Vạc.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Line 51 mentions wards in Mèo Vạc, but not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I can't definitively link the old ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a specific new ward based on the information provided. There's an ambiguity I need to flag.  I need clarification on what happened to the specific ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pải Lủng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mèo Vạc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" during the administrative re-organization.
