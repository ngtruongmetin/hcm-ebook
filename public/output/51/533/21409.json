  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with translating this old Vietnamese address, \"Xã Đức Nhuận, Huyện Mộ Đức, Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi,\" into its contemporary equivalent.  I see it's a matter of identifying the province, district, and ward changes mandated by recent resolutions. Given my expertise, here's how I'll break it down:\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the constituent parts of the old address.  \"Xã Đức Nhuận\" is the ward, \"Huyện Mộ Đức\" is the district, and \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\" is the province.  I know districts are being reorganized, so I'll keep that context in mind.\n\nNext, I need to check for any province mergers.  Based on the provided list of administrative unit mergers (60-NQ/TW), I see that Quảng Ngãi isn't on the list of provinces that *have* merged.  While Quảng Ngãi *was* considered for a merger with Kon Tum, the final decision resulted in Quảng Ngãi keeping its name.  This suggests no province-level change.\n\nNow, the real work begins. I'll meticulously examine the relevant resolutions, particularly \"1677/NQ-UBTVQH15,\" which addresses ward reorganizations within Quảng Ngãi.  Scanning the document, I immediately notice Line 22. It's a key piece of information, explicitly stating that \"Xã Đức Nhuận\" along with \"Thắng Lợi\" and \"Đức Hiệp\" is reorganized into a new ward called \"Xã Long Phụng.\"  This is highly relevant! I'll hold on to that for now.\n\nI'll quickly check the other resolution, \"1685/NQ-UBTVQH15.\" While it mentions \"phường Đức Nhuận,\" this pertains to Ho Chi Minh City, not Quảng Ngãi. Irrelevant.\n\nReturning to the key resolution, \"1677/NQ-UBTVQH15\", I'll cross-reference the identified \"xã Long Phụng\" with the \"New wards\" list.  I find a perfect match: a \"Xã Long Phụng\" associated with \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\"  It's exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nGiven that the resolution explicitly outlines the transition of \"Xã Đức Nhuận\" to \"Xã Long Phụng,\" my confidence in this mapping is high. This is a clear, direct correspondence established by the official resolutions.\n\nMy next step is to formulate the structured JSON output reflecting this mapping, ensuring it captures the identified \"Xã Long Phụng\" as the correct equivalent of the original ward in the given address. The JSON will reflect my high confidence in this determination.\n",
