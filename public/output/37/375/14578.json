  "thought": "**Navigating the Vietnamese Administrative Landscape**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vietnamese address mapping task. I've got to figure out where \"Xã Khánh Cường, Huyện Yên Khánh, Tỉnh Ninh Bình\" now resides, given some resolutions and a list of new wards.  First things first, I've broken down the old address:  \"Xã Khánh Cường\" (the ward), \"Huyện Yên Khánh\" (the district - which I need to remember, the prompt says districts are eliminated), and \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\" (the province).\n\nThe province, Ninh Bình, is where I'll begin. I'm checking if Ninh Bình is part of any of the \"merger\" scenarios detailed in the resolutions. It's not in the \"don't merge\" list, but I see it *was* involved in a merger. Apparently, Hà Nam, Nam Định and Ninh Binh were merged, but the name *Ninh Binh* was retained. So, from a province perspective, things haven't changed.\n\nNow, I'm diving into the resolutions to see what's become of \"Xã Khánh Cường.\" Resolution 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15 catches my attention: it directly mentions \"Xã Khánh Cường\" - it's merged into a new ward. It is being merged into \"Xã Khánh Thiện\".  Excellent! That's a strong lead.\n\nThere's another resolution (1674/NQ-UBTVQH15) mentioning \"Xã Yên Khánh\" as a new ward, but it's formed from different old wards. This makes me consider if \"Xã Yên Khánh\" will be named after the old district \"Huyện Yên Khánh\" that I need to eliminate.\n\nI glanced at another resolution (1677/NQ-UBTVQH15), but it describes a *different* \"Xã Khánh Cường\" being created in Quảng Ngãi province. That's a red herring. It's the same name, but in a totally different part of the country and based on a different set of old wards. Not helpful.\n\nSo, summing it up: it looks like \"Xã Khánh Cường\" is now part of the new ward called **Xã Khánh Thiện**.  I'm fairly confident in this mapping, given that 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15 specifically deals with the Ninh Bình province and the wording explicitly mentions the merge.\n",
